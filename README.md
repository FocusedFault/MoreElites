**SUBMIT ANY ISSUES USING THE LINK ABOVE**

There's a config for disabling specific elites and the Tier 2 HP/Damage Multipliers. Will fix crown displays at some point, some may be wonky.

## Tier 1

### Frenzied (RoR1)

- +2 base move speed
- +50% attack speed
- Teleport to closest enemy or in move direction

### Empowering

- 25m radius zone that applies a warbanner buff to itself and surrounding allies

## Tier 2

### Echo

- Clones die if main body is killed
- Clones fire hunter projectiles
